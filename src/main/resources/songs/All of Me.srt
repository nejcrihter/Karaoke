0
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,100
What would I do without your smart mouth?

1
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,700
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out

2
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,500
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,200
What's going on in that beautiful mind

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm on your magical mystery ride

5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:48,200
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,000
My head's under water

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,200
But I'm breathing fine

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,000
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,100
'Cause all of me

10
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,900
Loves all of you

11
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,700
Love your curves and all your edges

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,400
All your perfect imperfections

13
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,000
Give your all to me

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,700
I'll give my all to you

15
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,700
You're my end and my beginning

16
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,400
Even when I lose I'm winning

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:39,000
'Cause I give you all of me

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,200
And you give me all of you, oh oh

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,400
How many times do I have to tell you

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,100
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too

21
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:03,700
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood

22
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,400
You're my downfall, you're my muse

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,300
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues

24
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:19,500
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,500
My head's under water

26
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,700
But I'm breathing fine

27
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,500
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

28
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,400
'Cause all of me

29
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,500
Loves all of you

30
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,600
Love your curves and all your edges

31
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,700
All your perfect imperfections

32
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,200
Give your all to me

33
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll give my all to you

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,000
You're my end and my beginning

35
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,900
Even when I lose I'm winning

36
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:10,200
'Cause I give you all of me

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,900
And you give me all of you, oh oh

38
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,300
Give me all of you

39
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,900
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts

40
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,300
Risking it all, though it's hard

41
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,200
'Cause all of me

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,800
Loves all of you

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,900
Love your curves and all your edges

44
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,600
All your perfect imperfections

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,200
Give your all to me

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll give my all to you

47
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,000
You're my end and my beginning

48
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,700
Even when I lose I'm winning

49
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:11,400
'Cause I give you all of me

50
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:19,300
And you give me all of you

51
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,600
I give you all of me

52
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,800
And you give me all of you, oh oh
