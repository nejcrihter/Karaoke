0
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,200
I used to rule the world

1
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,000
Seas would rise when I gave the word

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,000
Now in the morning I sleep alone

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
Sweep the streets I used to own

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,900
I used to roll the dice

5
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,100
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,100
Listen as the crowd would sing

7
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,400
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,900
One minute I held the key

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,900
Next the walls were closed on me

10
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,800
And I discovered that my castles stand

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,200
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,800
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,100
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

15
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,600
My missionaries in a foreign field

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,100
For some reason I can't explain

17
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,200
Once you're gone there was never

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,000
Never an honest word

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,200
But that was when I ruled the world

20
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,300
It was the wicked and wild wind

21
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,400
Blew down the doors to let me in

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,400
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,800
People couldn't believe what I'd become

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,500
Revolutionaries wait

25
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,400
For my head on a silver plate

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,800
Just a puppet on a lonely string

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,100
Oh who would ever want to be king?

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,800
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,200
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,600
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

31
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,100
My missionaries in a foreign field

32
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,600
For some reason I can't explain

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,900
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

34
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,300
Never an honest word

35
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,500
But that was when I ruled the world

36
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

37
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,800
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,300
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

39
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,700
My missionaries in a foreign field

40
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,200
For some reason I can't explain

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,500
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

42
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,800
Never an honest word

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But that was when I ruled the world
