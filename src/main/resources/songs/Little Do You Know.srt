1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Little do you know

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,500
How I’m breaking while you fall asleep

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,100
Little do you know

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,000
I’m still haunted by the memory

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,300
Little do you know

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,600
I’m trying to pick myself from piece by piece

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,900
Little do you know

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,200
I need a little more time

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,700
Underneath it all I’m held captive by the hole inside

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,400
I’ve been holding back

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,200
For the fear that you might change your mind

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,900
I’m ready to forgive you but forgetting is a harder fight

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,100
Little do you know

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,000
I need a little more time

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,300
Away, away

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,900
I love you like you've never felt the pain, away

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,600
I promise you don’t have to be afraid, away

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:22,700
The love you see right here stays so lay your head on me

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,000
Little do you know 

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,200
I know you’re hurt while I'm sound asleep

21
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,500
Little do you know

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,800
All my mistakes are solely drowning me

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,200
Little do you know

24
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,400
I’m trying to make it better piece by piece

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,700
Little do you know

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,600
I, I love you till the sun dies

27
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,000
Away, just wait

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:00,600
I love you like I've never felt the pain, just wait

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:07,100
I love you like I’ve never been afraid, just wait

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:17,000
Our love we see right here stays so lay your head on me

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,300
Away, away

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,900
I love you like you've never felt the pain, away

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,400
I promise you don’t have to be afraid, away

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:42,000
The love you see right here stays so lay your head on me

35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,800
Lay your head on me

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,600
So lay your head on me

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,200
'Cause little do you know

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,900
I love you till the sun dies
